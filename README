Creating a bare metal STM32 project CubeMX project folder structure
===================================================================

Just take a look at the Makefile.

There's a few lines to configure concerning your device and device class.
You'll need to check out the appropriate CubeMX driver source repository
  and give its path to the Makefile using the $(CUBE) variable.

You can choose which $(HALMODULES) you want to compile in.
